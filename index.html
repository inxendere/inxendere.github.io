                My team's submission for ConUHacks 2024. We built an AI powered
                app that takes ingredients as input, and suggests dishes you can
                cook with them along with its cook time, difficulty, calories,
                and full instructions. Check out the demo video.

                <h3>The End of the World Is Just The Beginning</h3>
                <h3>by Peter Zeihan</h3>
                <p>
                  Very doompilling. Move to USA asap. Peter Zeihan has a really
                  fun way of writing that just draws you in and makes it hard to
                  put down the book. Other times his writing makes you wish he'd
                  stop treating you like a child. There's honestly not much here
                  that he didn't say in his previous book, but the predictions
                  are indeed updated as a lot has happened. Even if you don't
                  like geopolitics, I believe this is a must read.

                <h3>The Russian Revolution: A New History</h3>
                <h3>by Sean McMeekin</h3>
                <p>
                  The more I learn about Russian history the less I understand
                  it. This book starts a century before WW1, walks you through
                  the downfall of the Romanovs and the rise of the Bolsheviks,
                  and really shows you just how insane the Russian Revolution
                  was. Something that stood out to me was that near the
                  beginning of the revolution, the aristocrats would wear red
                  ribbons on their chests in solidarity with the protestors.
                  These same aristocrats would have their property stolen and
                  their lives taken by the same Bolshevik protestors they were
                  standing in solidarity with. Also Tsar Nicholas II was a
                  bigger wuss than I thought him to be. The book is filthy
                  detailed and I learned a ton.

                <p>
                  A little something about Iran because I know almost nothing
                  other than the surface level knowledge. The book talks about
                  the last shah of Iran, his life, and his downfall. Turns out
                  he was just another weak ruler not fit for the throne. His dad
                  was cool though. Also he had a fetish for tall women.

                <h3>by Barbara W. Tuchman</h3>
                <p>
                  WW1 and WW2 are my favourite subjects but I never read a
                  proper book on them, except this one. This recounts the
                  chaotic first month of WW1, and is honestly eye opening. A
                  million moving pieces to keep track of. Makes Game of Thrones
                  look like a children's book.

                <h3>Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union</h3>
                <h3>by Vladislav M. Zubok</h3>
                <p>
                  This book is about the fall of the USSR and secondarily, a
                  biography of Gorbachev. Might be one of my favourite books
                  ever and I plan to reread one day. Gorbachev truly was a
                  tragic hero. I wish for history to be kind to him and for us
                  to remember him with fondness. Everything he ever did, unlike
                  his predecessors, was truly for the betterment of his people.
                  He was averse to violence and would reprimand his subordinates
                  if they used force on protestors. Unfortunately he was die
                  hard communist blinded by the ideology.

                <h3>The Accidental Superpower</h3>
                <h3>by Peter Zeihan</h3>
                <p>
                  I watched several of Peter Zeihan's talks on geopolitics and
                  demographics so I thought it's only fair I get the full
                  picture by reading his book. This was such a ride. The books
                  is basically about why the US is set up for success and why no
                  matter what, the US will forever remain a superpower. It
                  taught me a lot about history, geopolitics, demographics, and
                  a lot more.

                  Leopold was the king of Belgium who basically took a huge
                  swath of land in Africa as his own personal property. The
                  misery and death he caused rivals that of Hitler's but few

                <h3>by William L. Shirer</h3>
                <p>
                  A filthy detailed book on the history of the Third Reich. I
                  read this book a long time ago but now with the knowledge I
                  have, I recognize that a lot of the information here is
                  contradictory and flat out wrong. However, the guy lived in
                  Germany during the war as a foreign correspondent, so his word
                  should still not be taken lightly. If you really want to read
                  about Germany in WW2, read another book on top of this one.
